# Tensorflow-Notes
Tensorflow from scratch
Welcome to my TensorFlow notes repository! This collection of notes is aimed at helping beginners and intermediate learners understand the fundamentals of TensorFlow, a powerful open-source machine learning library developed by Google. Whether you're interested in building neural networks, deep learning models, or exploring the latest advancements in AI, TensorFlow provides a flexible framework to bring your ideas to life.

# Getting Started with TensorFlow
What is TensorFlow?
TensorFlow is an open-source library for numerical computation and large-scale machine learning. It allows you to build and train neural networks, deploy machine learning models, and perform a variety of other numerical computations with ease. Tensors are the fundamental building blocks of TensorFlow. They are multidimensional arrays used to represent data in TensorFlow computations. In TensorFlow, computations are represented as graphs where nodes represent operations and edges represent data flowing between them. Sessions are used to execute operations in the TensorFlow graph.
